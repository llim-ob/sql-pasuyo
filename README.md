# sql-pasuyo

`sql-pasuyo` converts a Teamwork task link into a GitHub issue containing the SQL and operational instructions for a COMREC request.

It reads the Teamwork task, determines whether the request is a reload, replace-blob, rename, or delete operation, fills the matching local template, adds the appropriate tags to the Teamwork task, and creates one issue in the configured GitHub repository.

The script does not execute SQL, run shell commands, or create a pull request. For rename requests,
it performs one read-only Oracle `SELECT` to determine the existing file type before rendering the
GitHub issue.

## How To Use It

### 1. Install dependencies

From the project directory:

```bash
cd /Users/{your_folder}/Codes/sql-pasuyo
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `.venv` already exists, only the install command is needed.

### 2. Configure credentials

Create `.env` in the project directory:

```dotenv
# GitHub issue destination
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token # REQUIRED
GITHUB_OWNER=objectbrightph
GITHUB_REPO=sql-requests
GITHUB_LABEL=sql-request

# Teamwork authentication: use either API key or OAuth access token
TW_API_KEY=your_teamwork_api_key # REQUIRED
# TW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_teamwork_access_token

# Optional AI task classification
# QWEN_API_KEY=your_qwen_api_key
# QWEN_API_BASE=
# QWEN_MODEL=

# Read-only Oracle lookups for rename filenames and AI-adapter reloads
DB_CONNECTION=oracle
DB_DATABASE=database
DB_HOST=dbhost
DB_PASSWORD=dbpassword
DB_PORT=dbport
DB_USERNAME=dbuser
# Required for the older AIMSPRD server; use the directory containing libclntsh.dylib.
DB_ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB=/path/to/instantclient
```

Required values:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | Allows the script to create GitHub issues. |
| `TW_API_KEY` or `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | Allows the script to read and tag the Teamwork task. |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | No | GitHub owner. Defaults to `objectbrightph`. |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | No | GitHub repository. Defaults to `sql-requests`. |
| `GITHUB_LABEL` | No | Issue label. Defaults to `sql-request`. |
| `QWEN_API_KEY` | No | Enables Qwen classification. Without it, local rules are used. |
| `DB_CONNECTION` | Rename or reload | Must be `oracle` when a rename or reload is processed. |
| `DB_DATABASE` | Rename or reload | Oracle service name, such as `database`. |
| `DB_HOST` | Rename or reload | Oracle database host. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Rename or reload | Oracle read-only lookup password. |
| `DB_PORT` | Rename or reload | Oracle listener port, normally `1521`. |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Rename or reload | Oracle lookup username. |
| `DB_ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB` | Rename or reload | Directory containing the Oracle Instant Client libraries, such as `libclntsh.dylib`. Required for the older AIMSPRD server. |

Keep `.env` private. Never commit API keys or tokens.

### 3. Prepare the Teamwork task

The Teamwork task title or description should include:

- Feed ID, for example `Feed ID: 396` or `Feed 396`
- Adapter ID, for example `Adapter ID: 396`
- File ID, for example `File ID: 2756788`, `File (2756788)`, `File 2756788`, `blob for 2756788`, or a line such as `2780005 - 09/23/2026`

For a rename request, include both filenames:

```text
From: OLD_FILENAME
To: NEW_FILENAME
```

The description can also use natural-language filename changes:

```text
Update filename from OLD_FILENAME to NEW_FILENAME
```

The phrases `update file name`, `update filename`, `from OLD_FILENAME to NEW_FILENAME`,
and their equivalent title forms trigger rename classification. The script looks up the existing
filename in `carrier_file_workflow` using each extracted file ID, reads its `filename` column,
and appends/replaces that extension on the requested destination, for example `NEW_FILENAME.xlsx`.
The database lookup uses only `SELECT filename ... WHERE fileid = :fileid`; it does not update,
delete, commit, or otherwise modify the production database.

### Oracle Instant Client requirement

The AIMSPRD Oracle server is an older version that cannot be accessed by
`python-oracledb` Thin mode. Install the Oracle Instant Client for macOS, then set
the directory containing `libclntsh.dylib` in `.env`:

```dotenv
DB_ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB=/path/to/instantclient
```

The script initializes `python-oracledb` Thick mode before the read-only lookup.
It stops with a configuration error if the client libraries cannot be loaded.

The script also reads `feedId`, `adapterId`, and `fileIds` when those values are present in the Teamwork API response.
Before creating the issue, it prints the detail table derived from the adapter ID directly below the extracted File IDs.
Adapters below 600 use `ecs_detail_type<adapterId>`; adapters 600 and above use
`eps_detail_type<adapterId>`.

For reload requests, the script also performs a read-only lookup in
`carrier_feed_control` using the extracted feed ID. It examines Python
commandlines such as `python :5foldername/AI_script.py`; when the script
basename contains `AI_`, the file IDs are treated as AI adapters and the
request uses `template/ai_reload.txt`. Other reloads continue to use
`template/reload.txt`. If no matching AI commandline is found, the standard
reload template is used.

### 4. Submit the Teamwork link

Use the executable `paste-tw` to submit the Teamwork task link. From Finder, drag the
Teamwork task link onto `paste-tw` inside
the `sql-pasuyo` folder. macOS may pass the dropped link as a `.webloc` file;
the launcher reads its URL automatically.

You can also double-click `paste-tw`, then paste the Teamwork link when prompted. After
each process finishes, the launcher prompts for another link in the same
Terminal session:

```text
Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit): https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27255838
Issue created: https://github.com/objectbrightph/sql-requests/issues/123

Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit):
```

Press `Ctrl-D` at the prompt to close the session. Command-line launches with
an explicit URL still run once and exit.

From a terminal, run `paste-tw` with the Teamwork task URL:

```bash
./paste-tw \
  "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27255838"
```

Force an operation with a flag when the request wording is already known:

```bash
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --reload
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --delete
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --replace-blob
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --reload --fileid 2756788
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --replace-blob --fileid 2756788
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --reload --2756788
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --replace-blob --2756788

# Override IDs when the Teamwork task does not contain them
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" \
  --feed 396 --adapter 396 --fileid 2756788 --replace-blob
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" \
  --feed396 --adapter396 --2756788 --replace-blob
```

`--replace-blob` uses the existing reload template. `--rename` is also
available for an explicit filename-change request. The equivalent generic form
is `--operation reload`, `--operation delete`, `--operation rename`, or
`--operation replace-blob`. Use `--fileid FILE_ID` with `--reload` or
`--replace-blob` when the file ID should be supplied explicitly; it replaces
any file IDs extracted from the Teamwork task. The shorthand `--FILE_ID` is
also supported immediately after the operation flag, for example
`--reload --2756788` or `--replace-blob --2756788`. With the generic form,
use `--operation reload --2756788`. `--feed FEED_ID` and `--adapter ADAPTER_ID`
override the corresponding values extracted from the Teamwork task; `--feedid`
and `--adapterid` are aliases. Compact forms such as `--feed396`,
`--adapter396`, and `--2756788` are also supported. Feed and adapter overrides
can be used with any operation, but a file override still requires `--reload`
or `--replace-blob`.

If no operation flag is provided, the script fetches and analyzes the Teamwork
task using Qwen when configured, or local rules otherwise:

```bash
./paste-tw \
  "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684"
```

The same flags can be passed through `paste-tw` when launching from a terminal. A
dropped `.webloc` contains only the link, so it follows the analysis path unless an
operation flag is added to the launcher command.

For reload, replace-blob, delete, and rename requests, the script adds the
`SQL Request` tag to the Teamwork task. Replace-blob requests (selected with
`--replace-blob` or identified from `replace blob` wording) also receive the
`BLOB Update` tag. Existing Teamwork tags are preserved. Tagging happens before
the GitHub issue is created.

When using the interactive prompt, enter the link and optional flag as separate
space-delimited arguments:

```text
Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit): https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684 --reload
```

Both commands run the same Teamwork-to-GitHub process.

The URL must contain a numeric task ID in the `/tasks/<id>` path.

For a delete request, the command pauses and asks which delete template to use:

```text
Delete mode: choose 1 (delete1.txt) or 2 (delete2.txt):
```

Enter `1` or `2`, then let the command finish.

### Combined reload and delete requests

A single task can request both operations for different files:

```text
Feed ID: 652
Adapter ID: 652
Please reload File ID 2686743.
Please remove File IDs 2038976, 2038977, 2038975.
```

Run `paste-tw` normally; combined requests are detected locally, even when Qwen
is configured. The script creates **one GitHub issue**, with a reload section
for `2686743` and a delete section for `2038976,2038977,2038975`. It still asks
for delete mode `1` or `2`, and the reload section still uses the read-only
AI-adapter lookup and the appropriate reload template.

Each operation has its own heading and fenced `sql` code block, so reload and
delete instructions are displayed separately rather than inside one shared
block. Single-operation requests retain one `sql` code block.

To explicitly select combined handling, use:

```bash
./paste-tw "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27311849" --reload-delete
```

`--operation reload-delete` is equivalent. List file IDs after each action,
using `Reload File IDs: ...` and `Delete File IDs: ...` headers or sentences
like the example above. Each section supports the same file ID formats as a
single-operation task. The script stops if a section has no file IDs, any ID
cannot be assigned to an action, or the same ID appears in both groups.
`--fileid` is not supported for combined requests. The usual `SQL Request`
tag is added once; a combined replace-blob/delete request also gets `BLOB Update`.

### 5. Open the created GitHub issue

When successful, the command prints the created issue URL:

```text
Issue created: https://github.com/objectbrightph/sql-requests/issues/123
```

### 1. Parse the Teamwork link

`auto.py` extracts the numeric task ID from the link. It rejects links that do not contain a task ID.

### 2. Fetch the task

`tw_auth.py` authenticates with Teamwork and fetches:

```text
GET https://objectbright.teamwork.com/projects/api/v3/tasks/<task_id>.json
```

The script supports Teamwork API-key authentication with `TW_API_KEY` and OAuth bearer authentication with `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### 3. Extract task data

The title and description are normalized, then the script extracts values from
the task API fields, matching custom fields, and task text. If either ID is
not present in the main task response, `auto.py` also reads the task's
Teamwork custom-field endpoint so custom-field values with names such as
`Feed ID` and `Adapter ID` can be matched.

| Value | Supported examples |
| --- | --- |
| Feed ID | API `feedId`, a custom field named `Feed ID`, `Feed ID: 396`, or `Feed 396` |
| Adapter ID | API `adapterId`, a custom field named `Adapter ID`, or `Adapter ID: 396` |
| File ID | `File ID: 2756788`, `FileID 2756788`, `File #2756788`, `File (2756788)`, `File 2756788`, `blob for 2756788`, `for 2756788`, `2780005 - 09/23/2026`, `Please check files: 123213 1232131 81293 123123`, `Please check files: 123213, 1232131`, or a reload list after `following file id due to Error status.` |
| Rename source | `From: OLD_FILENAME` |
| Rename destination | `To: NEW_FILENAME`, or `from OLD_FILENAME to NEW_FILENAME` |

The script stops before creating the issue if feed ID, adapter ID, file ID, or title is missing. Rename operations also require a destination filename and the Oracle read-only filename lookup settings.

Reload requests may also contain a bare list of file IDs, with one numeric ID
per line, after the error-status sentence. For example, the IDs in
`Please reload the following file id due to Error status.\n2781420\n2781675`
are extracted as two file IDs.
Requests beginning with `check files` may list multiple IDs separated by
spaces or commas; both separators are supported.

### 4. Classify the operation

An explicit operation flag takes priority over task analysis. Supported flags
are `--reload`, `--delete`, `--rename`, and `--replace-blob`; the last one uses
the reload template for replacing a blob. If no flag is supplied, the script
analyzes the fetched Teamwork title and description.

Combined reload/delete requests are handled locally first so Qwen cannot collapse
them into one operation or combine their file IDs. For other requests, if
`QWEN_API_KEY` is configured, Qwen classifies the task. Qwen must return one of:

- `reload` for replacing or reprocessing a blob
- `rename` for changing a filename
- `delete` for removing data

Without Qwen, local deterministic rules classify the title and description. Unmatched requests default to `reload`.

Qwen does not generate SQL. It only selects the operation and, for a rename, returns the destination filename.

### 5. Render the request template

Operation templates are stored in `template/`:

| Operation | Template |
| --- | --- |
| Reload | `template/reload.txt` |
| AI adapter reload | `template/ai_reload.txt` when `carrier_feed_control.commandline` contains a Python script with `AI_` in its basename |
| Rename | `template/rename.txt` |
| Delete mode 1 | `template/delete1.txt` |
| Delete mode 2 | `template/delete2.txt` |

The selected template is filled with:

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `{feed_id}` | Extracted Teamwork feed ID |
| `{adapter_id}` | Extracted Teamwork adapter ID |
| `{fileids}` | File IDs joined with commas |
| `{filename}` | Rename destination filename with the file type from Oracle |

Plain reload requests use `Request Details: For Reload`. `--replace-blob`
requests use `Request Details: For Reload / BLOB Update`.

Reload classification requires the read-only Oracle lookup described above so
that AI adapter reloads can be distinguished from normal reloads. The lookup
uses the feed ID, selects Python commandlines from `carrier_feed_control`, and
does not update, delete, commit, or otherwise modify the production database.

The templates contain the SQL and any required shell commands or verification queries. Those instructions are included as text in the GitHub issue; they are not executed by `auto.py`.

### 6. Build the GitHub issue body

`sql_request.txt` is the outer GitHub issue template. It remains in the project root and contains the project, Teamwork, database, schema, and SQL sections.

The script replaces:

- `{teamwork_link}` with the original Teamwork URL
- `{the sql generated from python script}` with the selected, filled operation template

The GitHub issue title is the exact Teamwork task title.

### 7. Create the issue

The script sends one request to:

```text
POST https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/issues
```

The request includes:

```json
{
  "title": "Teamwork task title",
  "body": "Rendered sql_request.txt content",
  "labels": ["sql-request"]
}
```

The label comes from `GITHUB_LABEL`.

Before creating the issue, the script adds Teamwork tags through:

```text
PUT https://objectbright.teamwork.com/tasks/<task_id>/tags.json
```

Each tag is added without replacing existing tags. All supported operations add
`SQL Request`; replace-blob requests additionally add `BLOB Update`.

## OAuth Setup

API-key authentication is simplest. If OAuth is required:

1. Configure the Teamwork app client ID, client secret, and registered redirect URI.
2. Complete the Teamwork authorization flow and obtain the one-time authorization code.
3. Set `TW_CLIENT_ID`, `TW_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TW_AUTH_CODE`, and `TW_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env`.
4. Run `tw_auth.py` once to exchange the code for an access token.
5. Store the returned token as `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN` and remove `TW_AUTH_CODE`.

## Troubleshooting

### Teamwork authentication error

Confirm that `.env` contains either:

```dotenv
TW_API_KEY=your_teamwork_api_key
```

or:

```dotenv
TW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_teamwork_access_token
```

### Missing task data

Add feed, adapter, and file IDs to the Teamwork title or description. Rename requests also need a `To:` filename.

### Delete prompt does not work

Delete mode is interactive. Run the command from a terminal and enter `1` or `2` when prompted.

### GitHub API error

Check that:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid and can create issues.
- `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO` identify the correct repository.
- The configured `GITHUB_LABEL` is available in that repository.

### Python dependency error

Use the project virtual environment directly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./paste-tw "<teamwork-task-link>"
```
