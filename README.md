# auto-cr

`auto-cr` converts a Teamwork task link into a GitHub issue containing the SQL and operational instructions for a COMREC request.

It reads the Teamwork task, determines whether the request is a reload, rename, or delete operation, fills the matching local template, and creates one issue in the configured GitHub repository.

The script does not execute SQL, connect to a database, run shell commands, or create a pull request.

## How To Use It

### 1. Install dependencies

From the project directory:

```bash
cd /Users/liamrhysslim/Codes/auto-cr
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `.venv` already exists, only the install command is needed.

### 2. Configure credentials

Create `.env` in the project directory:

```dotenv
# GitHub issue destination
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
GITHUB_OWNER=objectbrightph
GITHUB_REPO=sql-requests
GITHUB_LABEL=sql-request

# Teamwork authentication: use either API key or OAuth access token
TW_API_KEY=your_teamwork_api_key
# TW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_teamwork_access_token

# Optional Qwen task classification
# QWEN_API_KEY=your_qwen_api_key
# QWEN_API_BASE=
# QWEN_MODEL=
```

Required values:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | Allows the script to create GitHub issues. |
| `TW_API_KEY` or `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | Allows the script to read the Teamwork task. |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | No | GitHub owner. Defaults to `objectbrightph`. |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | No | GitHub repository. Defaults to `sql-requests`. |
| `GITHUB_LABEL` | No | Issue label. Defaults to `sql-request`. |
| `QWEN_API_KEY` | No | Enables Qwen classification. Without it, local rules are used. |

Keep `.env` private. Never commit API keys or tokens.

### 3. Prepare the Teamwork task

The Teamwork task title or description should include:

- Feed ID, for example `Feed ID: 396` or `Feed 396`
- Adapter ID, for example `Adapter ID: 396`
- File ID, for example `File ID: 2756788`, `File (2756788)`, `File 2756788`, `blob for 2756788`, or a line such as `2780005 - 09/23/2026`

For a rename request, include both filenames:

```text
From: OLD_FILENAME
To: NEW_FILENAME
```

The script also reads `feedId`, `adapterId`, and `fileIds` when those values are present in the Teamwork API response.

### 4. Submit the Teamwork link

From Finder, drag the Teamwork task link onto the executable `a` file inside
the `auto-cr` folder. macOS may pass the dropped link as a `.webloc` file;
the launcher reads its URL automatically.

You can also double-click `a`, then paste the Teamwork link when prompted. After
each process finishes, the launcher prompts for another link in the same
Terminal session:

```text
Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit): https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27255838
Issue created: https://github.com/objectbrightph/sql-requests/issues/123

Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit):
```

Press `Ctrl-D` at the prompt to close the session. Command-line launches with
an explicit URL still run once and exit.

Command-line usage remains supported:

Run `auto.py` with the Teamwork task URL:

```bash
.venv/bin/python auto.py \
  "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27255838"
```

You can also use the `a` launcher from the project directory:

```bash
./a "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27255838"
```

Force an operation with a flag when the request wording is already known:

```bash
.venv/bin/python auto.py "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --reload
.venv/bin/python auto.py "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --delete
.venv/bin/python auto.py "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684" --replace-blob
```

`--replace-blob` uses the existing reload template. `--rename` is also
available for an explicit filename-change request. The equivalent generic form
is `--operation reload`, `--operation delete`, `--operation rename`, or
`--operation replace-blob`.

If no operation flag is provided, the script fetches and analyzes the Teamwork
task using Qwen when configured, or local rules otherwise:

```bash
.venv/bin/python auto.py \
  "https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684"
```

The same flags can be passed through `paste-tw` or `./a` when launching from a
terminal. A dropped `.webloc` contains only the link, so it follows the
analysis path unless an operation flag is added to the launcher command.

When using the interactive prompt, enter the link and optional flag as separate
space-delimited arguments:

```text
Paste Teamwork task link (Ctrl-D to quit): https://objectbright.teamwork.com/app/tasks/27261684 --reload
```

Both commands run the same Teamwork-to-GitHub process.

The URL must contain a numeric task ID in the `/tasks/<id>` path.

For a delete request, the command pauses and asks which delete template to use:

```text
Delete mode: choose 1 (delete1.txt) or 2 (delete2.txt):
```

Enter `1` or `2`, then let the command finish.

### 5. Open the created GitHub issue

When successful, the command prints the created issue URL:

```text
Issue created: https://github.com/objectbrightph/sql-requests/issues/123
```

```

### 1. Parse the Teamwork link

`auto.py` extracts the numeric task ID from the link. It rejects links that do not contain a task ID.

### 2. Fetch the task

`tw_auth.py` authenticates with Teamwork and fetches:

```text
GET https://objectbright.teamwork.com/projects/api/v3/tasks/<task_id>.json
```

The script supports Teamwork API-key authentication with `TW_API_KEY` and OAuth bearer authentication with `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

### 3. Extract task data

The title and description are normalized, then the script extracts:

| Value | Supported examples |
| --- | --- |
| Feed ID | `Feed ID: 396`, `Feed 396` (including titles such as `Adapter ID 291 Feed 291`) |
| Adapter ID | `Adapter ID: 396` |
| File ID | `File ID: 2756788`, `FileID 2756788`, `File #2756788`, `File (2756788)`, `File 2756788`, `blob for 2756788`, `for 2756788`, `2780005 - 09/23/2026` |
| Rename source | `From: OLD_FILENAME` |
| Rename destination | `To: NEW_FILENAME` |

The script stops before creating the issue if feed ID, adapter ID, file ID, or title is missing. Rename operations also require a destination filename.

### 4. Classify the operation

An explicit operation flag takes priority over task analysis. Supported flags
are `--reload`, `--delete`, `--rename`, and `--replace-blob`; the last one uses
the reload template for replacing a blob. If no flag is supplied, the script
analyzes the fetched Teamwork title and description.

If `QWEN_API_KEY` is configured, Qwen classifies the task. Qwen must return one of:

- `reload` for replacing or reprocessing a blob
- `rename` for changing a filename
- `delete` for removing data

Without Qwen, local deterministic rules classify the title and description. Unmatched requests default to `reload`.

Qwen does not generate SQL. It only selects the operation and, for a rename, returns the destination filename.

### 5. Render the request template

Operation templates are stored in `template/`:

| Operation | Template |
| --- | --- |
| Reload | `template/reload.txt` |
| Rename | `template/rename.txt` |
| Delete mode 1 | `template/delete1.txt` |
| Delete mode 2 | `template/delete2.txt` |

The selected template is filled with:

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `{feed_id}` | Extracted Teamwork feed ID |
| `{adapter_id}` | Extracted Teamwork adapter ID |
| `{fileids}` | File IDs joined with commas |
| `{filename}` | Rename destination filename |

Plain reload requests use `Request Details: For Reload`. `--replace-blob`
requests use `Request Details: For Reload / BLOB Update`.

The templates contain the SQL and any required shell commands or verification queries. Those instructions are included as text in the GitHub issue; they are not executed by `auto.py`.

### 6. Build the GitHub issue body

`sql_request.txt` is the outer GitHub issue template. It remains in the project root and contains the project, Teamwork, database, schema, and SQL sections.

The script replaces:

- `{teamwork_link}` with the original Teamwork URL
- `{the sql generated from python script}` with the selected, filled operation template

The GitHub issue title is the exact Teamwork task title.

### 7. Create the issue

The script sends one request to:

```text
POST https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/issues
```

The request includes:

```json
{
  "title": "Teamwork task title",
  "body": "Rendered sql_request.txt content",
  "labels": ["sql-request"]
}
```

The label comes from `GITHUB_LABEL`.

## OAuth Setup

API-key authentication is simplest. If OAuth is required:

1. Configure the Teamwork app client ID, client secret, and registered redirect URI.
2. Complete the Teamwork authorization flow and obtain the one-time authorization code.
3. Set `TW_CLIENT_ID`, `TW_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TW_AUTH_CODE`, and `TW_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env`.
4. Run `tw_auth.py` once to exchange the code for an access token.
5. Store the returned token as `TW_ACCESS_TOKEN` and remove `TW_AUTH_CODE`.

## Troubleshooting

### Teamwork authentication error

Confirm that `.env` contains either:

```dotenv
TW_API_KEY=your_teamwork_api_key
```

or:

```dotenv
TW_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_teamwork_access_token
```

### Missing task data

Add feed, adapter, and file IDs to the Teamwork title or description. Rename requests also need a `To:` filename.

### Delete prompt does not work

Delete mode is interactive. Run the command from a terminal and enter `1` or `2` when prompted.

### GitHub API error

Check that:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid and can create issues.
- `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO` identify the correct repository.
- The configured `GITHUB_LABEL` is available in that repository.

### Python dependency error

Use the project virtual environment directly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python auto.py "<teamwork-task-link>"
```
